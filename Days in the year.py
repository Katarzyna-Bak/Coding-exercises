"""
A variation of determining leap years, assuming only
integers are used and years can be negative and positive.

Write a function which will return the days in the year
and the year entered in a string. For example 2000,
entered as an integer, will return as a string 2000
has 366 days

There are a few assumptions we will accept the year 0,
even though there is no year 0 in the Gregorian Calendar.

Also the basic rule for validating a leap year are as
follows

Most years that can be divided evenly by 4 are leap years.

Exception: Century years are NOT leap years UNLESS they
can be evenly divided by 400.

So the years 0, -64 and 2016 will return 366 days. Whilst
1974, -10 and 666 will return 365 days.
