"""
Task:
A magician in the subway showed you a trick, he put an ice
brick in a bottle to impress you.The bricks width and height
are equal, forming a square. Just for fun and also to impress
the magician and people around, you decided to calculate the
brick's volume. Write a function iceBrickVolume that will
except these parameters:

radius - bottle's radius (always > 0);
bottleLength - total bottle length (always > 0);
rimLength - length from bottle top to brick (always <
bottleLength);
And return volume of ice brick that magician managed to put
into a bottle.

illustration

Note:
All inputs are integers. Assume no irregularities to the
cuboid brick. You may assume the bottle is shaped like
a cylinder. The brick cannot fit inside the rim.

All inputs are integers.

Examples:
ice_brick_volume(1, 10, 2) # => 16
ice_brick_volume(5, 30, 7) # => 1150

def ice_brick_volume(radius, bottle_length, rim_length):
    return (bottle_length-rim_length)*(radius**2)*2

print("Tests:")
print(ice_brick_volume(1, 10, 2))
print(ice_brick_volume(5, 30, 7))
